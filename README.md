# Password Manager 
Aziyar Ahmed

Is a program that is used to store and manage the passwords that a user has for various online accounts and security features. Password managers store the passwords  and provide secure access to all the password information with the help of a master key.
that let you remember just one password to unlock your unique passwords for every other site and service.
i used for the's program module: 
sqlite3
tkinter 
clipboard

if i had more time i was trying encrypt and decrypt my database using module cryptography, using symmetric encryption whit a key  to encrypt and decrypt a password and the username, and i was thinking of using the Fernet class which is an implementation of AES
so every time i encrypt i will need a key and i will use the same key to decrypt.
